HELLO, I¡¯M SATURN. I¡¯M PROUD TO BE A PART OF MILKY WAY.

Galaxy is on your hand

 
Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two known moons orbit the planet, of which fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of "moonlets" comprising the rings.
